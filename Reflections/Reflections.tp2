PLAN FOR PART 1:
3)
 - change Belt's dialogue after doppel attack - no teleport, dunno location
 - put block on entrance to maze
 - maybe move entrance to maze...?
4)
 - place korlasz' crypt
 - script messenger to tell you where it is; put some FF outside it
 - FF captain dialogue into Korlasz crypt
 - change korlasz dialogue(s) mentioning sarevok dead
 - end of korlasz takes you back to the surface - see EBG1
5)
 - report to Belt; script Entar to enter and accuse you
 - Belt give wardstone
6)
 - allow entrance to maze; script some FF to die near traps
 - maybe change sarevok fight?
 - no game end after sarevok; see EBG1
7)
 - write dialogues for after: people pissed there is no body, no way to confirm your story
 - BREAK POINT: if continue to SoD, have them tell you you can prove your self by helping the city against the crusade, it is more important than figuring out yet another doppelganger situation
 - OR:.......if jump to BG2, say in no uncertain terms that the crusade is not your concern, the military can handle it; you need to get to the bottom of this clone thing. They say if that's your choice, the FF will march north without you.
 - ...if you want to investigate the clone, have Entar say the assassin is already in custody
8a)
 - if skip SoD, cut scene to cells, spawn clone in cell
 - put brightly glowing bracers on clone
 - dialogue with/about clone
 - script timestop, teleport, party member removal
 - continue dialogue, everyone leaves, lose all inventory
9a)
 - fade out/in, run SoD escape sequence
 - change dialogues where needed
 - ...i.e. imoen saying you attacked her, but it wasn't you, or something.

8b)
 - if go to SoD, put a pin in the clone investigation
 - later in SoD, have Skie sent back to BG by the FF
 - keep the cut-scene where she dies, but place it in the city instead of in Dragonspear
 - when you return, Entar is out of his mind, accuses you of persecuting his family
 - ...notes that Eddard's death coincided with your leaving Candlekeep; coincidence???
 - then notes that the asssassin is already in custody; appears to be a doppelganger or something, which matches the methods Sarevok was using... looks very bad
 - then confront the clone
 - scripted tomestop, teleport, party removal
9b)
 - then modded escape scene as above
